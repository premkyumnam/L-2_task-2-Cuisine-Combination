# L-2_task-2-Cuisine-Combination

I'm excited to share my Task-2 (Level 2): CUISINE COMBINATIONS in the Data Analysis Internship Program with Cognifyz Technologies!

🔹Project Overview:

In this video, I analyzed a given restaurant dataset to explore insights on:
1. Identify the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset and
2. Determine if certain cuisines combinations tend to have higher ratings.

🔹 Key Insights: 
After performing a thorough analysis, here are the findings:
1. The most common combinations of Cuisines in the dataset are: 
- North Indian: 936
- North Indian, Chinese: 511
- Chinese: 354
- Fast Food: 354
- North Indian, Mughlai: 334
- ...
- Bengali, Fast Food: 1
- North Indian, Rajasthani, Asian: 1
- Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian: 1
- Bakery, Desserts, North Indian, Bengali, South Indian: 1
- Italian, World Cuisine: 1.

2. The Top 10 most common cuisine combinations with higher average ratings are: 

Cuisine Combination | No_of_Cuisine | Average Rating 
0 North Indian | 936 | 1.67 
1 North Indian, Chinese | 511 | 2.42 
2 Chinese | 354 | 2.04 
3 Fast Food | 354 | 2.12 
4 North Indian, Mughlai | 334 | 2.89 
5 Cafe | 299 | 2.89 
6 Bakery | 218 | 1.92 
7 North Indian, Mughlai, Chinese | 197 2.57 
8 Bakery, Desserts | 170 | 2.32 
9 Street Food | 149 | 2.16 

Thus, I completed the Task-2 of Level-2 in the Data Analysis Internship Program.

🛠️Tools & Technologies Used:

To achieve this Task2 of level 2, I used the following tools and technologies:

1. Python – used as a programming language for data analysis
2. NumPy – used for efficient numerical computations
3. Pandas – used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
4. Matplotlib – used for creating visualizations like charts and plots
5. Seaborn – used for advanced statistical data visualization
6. Jupyter Notebook (Primary IDE) - used for writing and executing code.

These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.
