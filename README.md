    <h1> Task-2(Level2): Cuisine-Combinations</h1>

üöÄI'm excited to share my Task-2 (Level 2): CUISINE COMBINATIONS in the Data Analysis Internship Program with Cognifyz Technologies!

<h2>üîπProject Overview:</h2>

In this video, I analyzed a given restaurant dataset to explore insights on:
1. Identify the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset and
2. Determine if certain cuisines combinations tend to have higher ratings.

<h2>üîπ Key Insights: </h2>
After performing a thorough analysis, here are the findings:<br>
1. The most common combinations of Cuisines in the dataset are: <br>
- North Indian: 936<br>
- North Indian, Chinese: 511<br>
- Chinese: 354<br>
- Fast Food: 354<br>
- North Indian, Mughlai: 334<br>
- ...<br>
- Bengali, Fast Food: 1<br>
- North Indian, Rajasthani, Asian: 1<br>
- Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian: 1<br>
- Bakery, Desserts, North Indian, Bengali, South Indian: 1<br>
- Italian, World Cuisine: 1<br><br>

2. The Top 10 most common cuisine combinations with higher average ratings are: <br>

Cuisine Combination | No_of_Cuisine | Average Rating <br>
0 North Indian | 936 | 1.67 <br>
1 North Indian, Chinese | 511 | 2.42 <br>
2 Chinese | 354 | 2.04 <br>
3 Fast Food | 354 | 2.12 <br>
4 North Indian, Mughlai | 334 | 2.89 <br>
5 Cafe | 299 | 2.89 <br>
6 Bakery | 218 | 1.92 <br>
7 North Indian, Mughlai, Chinese | 197 2.57 <br>
8 Bakery, Desserts | 170 | 2.32 <br>
9 Street Food | 149 | 2.16 <br>

Thus, I completed the Task-2 of Level-2 in the Data Analysis Internship Program.<br>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏èTools & Technologies Used:</h2><br>

To achieve this Task2 of level 2, I used the following tools and technologies:<br>

1. Python ‚Äì used as a programming language for data analysis
2. NumPy ‚Äì used for efficient numerical computations
3. Pandas ‚Äì used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
4. Matplotlib ‚Äì used for creating visualizations like charts and plots
5. Seaborn ‚Äì used for advanced statistical data visualization
6. Jupyter Notebook (Primary IDE) - used for writing and executing code.

These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.
üéâ I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and sharpen my data analysis skills. Thank you to Cognifyz Technologies for this amazing learning experience! I'm excited to continue growing and taking on new challenges.
